# Advance Regression Assignment

## House Price Prediction Assignment

### Problem Statement:
 A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

 Essentially, the company wants to know â€”

    Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

    How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
